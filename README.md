### --- Description : ---

The goal of the project is to recode the printf function from libc.

The printf function is frequently used to display various elements to the user. It can print characters, strings, positive or negative integers, unsigned numbers, hexadecimal values, memory addresses, or even the % character.

It uses format specifiers (such as %d, %s, %x) to determine how to interpret and format the data. Finally, printf returns the total number of characters printed.

printf begins by scanning the string character by character. As long as it does not encounter a %, it simply prints the characters as they are. When it detects a %, it understands that this is a format specifier. It then reads the next character to determine what type of value it needs to handle:

- %c → print a character

- %s → print a string

- %d / %i → print a signed integer

- %u → print an unsigned integer

- %x / %X → print a number in hexadecimal

- %p → print a memory address

- %% → print the % character itself

Once the type is identified, printf retrieves the corresponding argument from the list of variable parameters, converts it to the appropriate format, and prints it.

It then continues reading the rest of the string until the end.

Finally, printf returns the total number of characters printed, allowing the calling program to know how many characters were written to the screen.




### ---  Instructions : ---

- To compile the project, run: make

- This will generate the libftprintf.a library, which you can link to your own programs.

- include the header --> #include "ft_printf.h" in your file .

- compile your program with --> cc your_program.c libftprintf.a

- you can now use ft_printf in your programs.


### --- Operation : ---

Here, I will detail how ft_printf works. As mentioned at the beginning of this document, printf receives a variable number of elements to print.

To handle a variable number of arguments, ft_printf relies on the tools provided by the <stdarg.h> library. Since the function does not know in advance how many arguments it will receive or what their types are, these macros allow it to access them safely and sequentially.

- va_list -> structure to store the variable arguments.

- va_start ->  Initializes the va_list.

- va_arg(list, type) Retrieve each argument depending on its type.

- va_end(list) Cleans up the va_list once all arguments have been processed.

So . Ft_printf starts by reading the format string from left to right.

As long as it encounters regular characters, it simply prints them.

When it finds a %, it recognizes that a format specifier follows.



It then reads the next character to determine which type of data must be processed (character, string, integer, hexadecimal, pointer, etc.).

It calls va_arg with the appropriate type , converts the retrieved value into a string representation.

It prints the result and updates the total character count.

Then he continues reading the string format until the end.


### --- Algorithm & data stucture justification : ---


Scanning the string sequentially is the simplest and most efficient approach.

Handling each % as a “special event” keeps the logic clean.

Each conversion (%d, %s, %x, etc.) is implemented in a dedicated function, improving readability and maintainability.

It allows modular handling of each format specifier.
